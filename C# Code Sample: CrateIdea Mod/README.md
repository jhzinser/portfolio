This is a Terraria mod, meant to interface with the game through tModLoader. Its purpose is to add additional item crates to the game, which are obtainable via fishing.

The project normally includes a bin folder; this folder was not altered in any way, so it has been excluded from this repo.

The mod's latest version is publicly available through its steam page at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018657505
